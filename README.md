# Welcome to Ancient Cave

Hello all, I'm excited to share the creation of a small 2D RPG game inspired by the "Ancient Cave" dungeon from Lufia 2.

## Description

This project is an earnest attempt at lovingly recreating the nostalgic experience of playing the Ancient Cave in Lufia 2 - the charm of its breakthrough mechanics, its fascinating puzzles, and its exciting battles. It's not flashy or revolutionary, but I've tried to keep things as authentic and warm as possible, in my own way.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, please make sure you have:
- .NET 6.0
- MonoGame 3.8

## Getting Started

Clone this project:
bash git clone [repository_url]

Navigate to the game directory and run:
bash dotnet run

Please note, it's a hobby project and far from perfect, but I hope it brings the joy of the Ancient Cave to you in its own small way!

## Getting Involved

If you have feedback, suggestions, or found bugs (we all know there will be bugs), please feel free to share. I'm here to learn, iterate, and make this little game as fun as it can be!

## Contact

Any questions or comments, just drop me a line - [nicolas.gehrke@googlemail.com](mailto:nicolas.gehrke@googlemail.com)

I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!Please note, it's a hobby project and far from perfect, but I hope it brings the joy of the Ancient Cave to you in its own small way!
