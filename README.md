# Ancient Cave - A Lufia 2 Inspired 2D JRPG/Roguelite

Hello all, I'm excited to share the creation of a small 2D JRPG/Roguelite game inspired by the "Ancient Cave" dungeon from Lufia 2.

## Technical description

This project is a learning experience for me in the basics of game programming and getting used to tools and terminology.
This project will use Monogame at its core, making it playable across multiple platforms (Windows/Linux, with Android planned for the future).
As for my current idea, i'll try to get as much as possible done by scratch.
The game uses a data-driven approach for easy modding and user-created content.
I plan on adding localization, at least for english and german. Might add some ai translations for European languages.

## Game description

#Experience the thrill of classic top-down 2D battles 
with strategic turn-based combat and a variety of character classes to master. Unlike other games, forget random encounters! In the depths of the Ancient Cave, enemies react to your every move, keeping you on your toes.

#Explore a sprawling labyrinth of 100 procedurally generated levels. 
Each delve into the cave promises a fresh challenge, as you fight your way through hordes of enemies and uncover powerful treasures.

#Begin your adventure alone and unarmored. 
As you delve deeper, you'll find loyal companions, powerful armor and weapons, devastating spells, and even capture monsters to fight at your side.

#The focus is on pure, unadulterated, and endlessly repeatable gameplay.
While there's no overarching narrative, the joy comes from the constant challenge and the freedom to customize your experience through mods. Want new companions? New enemies? Maybe even a whole new dungeon? With modding support, the possibilities are endless!


## Getting Involved

If you have feedback, suggestions, or found bugs (we all know there will be bugs), please feel free to share. I'm here to learn, iterate, and make this little game as fun as it can be!
